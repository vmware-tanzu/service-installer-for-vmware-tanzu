## Known Issues

- Service Installer for VMware Tanzu is unable to fetch cluster images from the content library. This happens due to a known issue with Tanzu on vSphere. The subscribed content library needs to be synced manually sometimes to update with the images.
- TMC integration of management and workload clusters fails for AWS non air-gapped compliant deployment, due to a known issue in the TMC API.
- Prometheus deployment fails if SaaS is activated in non-airgapped AWS deployment.
- Vcd Api call takes time depending on environment configuration , please re-trigger  the SIVT command after 1 min delay  
- Creating ALB Service Engine Group assignment to Edge Gateway fails intermittently. [Terraform provider issue](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcd/issues/923)
- Activating AVI L7 on vSphere with NSXT environments over NodePortLocal mode fails to bringup AKO pods.
- SIVT is supposed to download `Ubuntu-2004-kube-v1.22.9.ova`. Currently, it is downloading `Ubuntu-2004-kube-v1.23.8.ova`.
  **Note:** If user needs a specific version of Ubuntu + K8S ova, download it from marketplace and upload it to the K8S catalog.
- Harbor deployment fails both with and without SaaS in multi workload cluster configurations in non-airgapped AWS deployment.
- In case you are using proxy with self-signed or custom CA certificate, SIVT fails to pull the `kind` image while deploying Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management cluster in a vSphere VDS environment.</br>
  **Resolution:** Before initiating the deployment with SIVT, perform the following steps:

  1. Import the proxy certificate into the SIVT VM.
  2. Run the following commands:
      ```
      cat proxy-cert.pem >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
      systemctl restart docker
      ```
- In case you are using SIVT OVA with embedded Harbor, if Docker restarts or SIVT VM reboots, it may result in embedded Harbor failure. 

  **Resolution:** Perform the following steps:

  1. SSH to the SIVT VM.
  2. Go to the `/opt/vmware/arcas/tools/harbor`
  3. Run the following commands:
      ```
      docker-compose stop
      find common/ -type f -exec chmod 0755 \{\} \;
      docker-compose up -d
      ```
- Tanzu Kubernetes Grid deployment with NSX-T networking fails with `Failed to configure vcf list index out of range`.

  **Resolution:** This issue occurs only when you deactivate the shared services cluster in UI or the config file and proceed with management or workload cluster deployment.
  If the shared services cluster is activated and all the configuration details are provided, then deployment proceeds.
