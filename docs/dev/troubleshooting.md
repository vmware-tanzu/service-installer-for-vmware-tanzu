# Troubleshooting

When running commands or developing locally, sometimes things may go awry and
you may need more information on the status of the cluster.

The following tips may be useful when troubleshooting aspects of Tanzu Framework.

## Verbose Output

The Tanzu CLI provides a flag to enable verbose logging output. Using this command-line option can provide valuable information when you're investigating unexpected behavior or results.

`--verbose      For log verbosity`

## Open an Issue

If you run into a situation where the main branch will not
build cleanly, open an issue for Framework so the team can help.
