Description: >

  !!! NOTE: ONLY ONE TYPE OF DAY2 OPERATION IS SUPPORTED DURING ONE EXECUTION. !!!

  The day2-desired-state.yml file is responsible to refer that what
  type of day2 operation to be executed on the clusters.



  target_cluster can be name of the cluster to be upgrade. Target cluster can also be
  "all" to upgrade all clusters

  resize_memory_mb and resize_cpu SHOULD NOT BE LOWER than the current size.
  resize_cpu refers to the cpu count

  Specify none if cpu/memory need not be resized against resp.

  control_plane_node_count and worker_node_count SHOULD NOT BE LOWER than the
  current node count.

  If you initially deployed a development management cluster with
  one control plane node and you scale it up to 3 control plane nodes,
